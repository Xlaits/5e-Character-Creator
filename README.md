# 5e Character Creator
A Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition character creator written solely in C++.

## A little info about the project

This is a cumulation of my COP2334 class in college. This project is here to 
make sure I know everything I was taught in class, and maybe pick up a few
new skills.

This will be a simble, Console-based D&D Character Creator and Viewer. I hope
to make it cross-platform between Linux, Mac, and Windows, but I do not have a 
mac to test this program on. I have an install disc for an older OSX, so I may
do a VirtualBox instance to do any Mac testing.

I will work on the implementation of character creation though several methods
first before working on the character viewer and the character leveler.

### To Do:
* Character Creation - Guided Mode
* Character Creation - Expert Mode
* Rolled stats
* Point-Buy stats
* Character Advancement
* Character Viewer

### Possibilities:
* Homebrew Races
* Homebrew Classes
* Homebrew Spells
* Inventory/Money Management
* Dice Roller
* HP/Spell Slot/Spell Management
